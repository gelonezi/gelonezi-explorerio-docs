This quickstart guide will help you get ExplorerIO up and running in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- A web browser

## Quick Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gelonezi/explorerio.git
cd explorerio
```

### 2. Start with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will:

- Pull all necessary Docker images
- Start all required services
- Set up the database
- Initialize the application

### 3. Access the Application

Once the containers are running, you can access ExplorerIO at:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

### 4. Default Login

Use these default credentials for your first login:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

⚠️ **Important**: Change the default password after your first login!

## Next Steps

Now that ExplorerIO is running, you can:

1. **Explore the Interface**: Navigate through the different sections of the UI
2. **Configure Services**: Set up integrations with your data sources
3. **Set Up Authentication**: Configure your preferred authentication method
4. **Import Data**: Start importing and exploring your data

## Common Issues

### Port Already in Use

If port 8080 is already in use, you can change it in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8081:8080"  # Change 8081 to your preferred port
```

### Container Startup Issues

Check the logs if containers fail to start:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```
