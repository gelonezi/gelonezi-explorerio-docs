This document outlines how we use project boards to organize and track work on ExplorerIO. Our project management approach is designed to be transparent, collaborative, and efficient.

## Overview

We use GitHub Project Boards to manage our development workflow. Each board represents different aspects of the project lifecycle, from planning to release.

2. **Branch**: Create feature branch from main
3. **Development**: Implement changes with tests
4. **Review**: Create pull request for code review
5. **Testing**: QA testing if required
6. **Merge**: Merge to main branch
7. **Deployment**: Deploy to staging/production

## Contribution Guidelines

### For Team Members

**Issue Assignment**:
- Assign yourself to issues you're working on
- Move issues through board columns as status changes
- Update issue descriptions with progress notes
- Link related issues and pull requests

**Pull Request Process**:
- Link PR to relevant issue(s)
- Add appropriate labels
- Request reviews from team members
- Update project board when PR is merged

### For Community Contributors

**Getting Started**:
1. Browse issues labeled `good-first-issue`
2. Comment on issue to express interest
3. Wait for maintainer response before starting work
4. Follow contribution guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](guidelines.md)

**Issue Selection**:
- Start with issues labeled `help-wanted`
- Avoid issues already assigned to others
- Ask questions if requirements are unclear
- Discuss approach before implementing large changes

## Board Automation

### GitHub Actions Integration

We use automated workflows to move issues through boards:

**On Issue Creation**:
- Auto-assign to triage column
- Add `needs-triage` label
- Notify maintainers

**On PR Creation**:
- Move linked issues to "In Progress"
- Add reviewer assignments
- Run automated tests

**On PR Merge**:
- Move issues to "Done" or "Testing"
- Close completed issues
- Update project milestones

### Custom Automations

**Sprint Board Automation**:
```yaml
name: Sprint Board Automation
on:
  issues:
    types: [assigned, closed]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed]

jobs:
  move-cards:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Move issue to In Progress
        if: github.event.action == 'assigned'
        uses: alex-page/github-project-automation-plus@v0.8.1
        with:
          project: Sprint Planning
          column: In Progress
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
